# Advent of Code 2025

This repo contains my solutions to the advent of code 2025 [see
here](https://adventofcode.com/2025/).

The code is written in a literate programming style using Emacs ~.org~ files
which tangle into code files in the `/code` folder (there is no guaranty that
those files will run as I run everything from the `.org` files). Furthermore, I
added a small bash script that downloads the input files automatically with a
session cookie given in the `.env` file (shhh, it's secret). You can also add
your own inputs by adding them directly into the `/input` folder, the format is
`Day$n.txt` where `$n` is the number of the day (without leading zeros).

I think I will write most of this using Haskell, since I rarely have an
opportunity to use it otherwise.
